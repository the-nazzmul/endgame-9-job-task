          LOGO is a platform that can be a good starting point for a full
          E-commerce site. This project handles some complex API calls to
          enhance the developer to be better with APIs. The UI is also built
          with Shadcn which requires a little learning curve. But That little
          curve could be a good start for starting the exploration journey of
          front-end development.
